# What is Echo?

Echo is the billing infrastructure for AI applications. Replace your OpenAI import with Echo's drop-in SDK and instantly get user authentication, usage-based billing, and revenue sharing. Your users get one universal balance that works across all Echo-powered apps, eliminating payment friction and creating network effects that grow your user base.

Like Clerk handles authentication complexity, Echo handles AI billing complexity. No Stripe integration, no payment processing, no surprise bills. Set your markup percentage, and Echo handles everything else - from user authentication to transaction recording to revenue distribution. Your OpenAI code works unchanged, but now it generates revenue.

Echo supports both traditional server-side patterns and modern client-side architectures. The React SDK enables secure LLM calls directly from browsers using OAuth2 + PKCE, eliminating API key exposure while maintaining per-user billing. Choose your integration pattern below to get started.
