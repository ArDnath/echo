Echo maintains authentication using HTTP Cookies. The browser does not have access
to these so login state needs to be handled by server components.



# Client-Side Sign In
In your application you can use the `signIn` method to initiate server-side Echo sign-in.


```typescript
"use client"

import { signIn } from "@merit-systems/echo-next-sdk/client";

export default SignInButton() {
  return <button onClick={() => signIn()}>Sign In</button>
}
```
