# Client

Minimal client-side API for initiating the Echo OAuth flow.

## signIn

Starts the OAuth flow by redirecting the browser to your Echo OAuth route.

```typescript
import { signIn } from '@merit-systems/echo-next-sdk/client';

'use client';

export default function SignInButton() {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => signIn()}>
      Sign in with Echo
    </button>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="info">
`signIn()` must be called from client components. It performs a full-page redirect to `/api/echo/signin` by default.
</Callout>

### Custom basePath

If you placed your catch‑all route somewhere else, pass a `basePath` override:

```typescript
signIn({ basePath: '/api/auth/echo' });
```

Make sure the matching catch‑all route exists at `app/api/auth/echo/[...echo]/route.ts` and that your Echo instance is configured with the same `basePath`.

## useChat

Echo works seamlessly with Vercel AI SDK’s `useChat` hook; usage is the same as in their docs.

```typescript
import { useChat } from 'ai/react';
```

See the official guide: [Vercel AI – useChat](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat#usechat).

### Other AI React hooks

Echo works out of the box with all `use*` hooks from the Vercel AI React SDK (for example `useCompletion`, `useAssistant`). No extra configuration is needed—the SDK handles auth via cookies and your API routes work the same.
